# usdf-zsdf-dialogue-generator

A dialogue generator using both formats, [USDF](https://github.com/rheit/zdoom/blob/master/specs/usdf.txt) and [ZSDF](https://github.com/coelckers/gzdoom/blob/master/specs/usdf_zdoom.txt).

Current status:

- [x] Generate a dialogue
- [ ] Receive user input, and generate a dialogue from it
- [ ] Close v1.0.0

Desirable stuff:
- [ ] For CLI, use [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) instead of raw C++ for input
- [ ] Create an REST API using [Pistache](http://pistache.io/), to be consumed by some webapp (React? Angular?)
